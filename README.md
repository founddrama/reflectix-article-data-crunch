# Reflectix Article Data Crunch

Here's the Rmd for the November 2018 _Brew Your Own_ article that I wrote about
using Reflectix for kettle insulation when brewing-in-a-bag.

The article appears on the _BYO_ website (paywalled):

**Tl;dr:** Reflectix makes a difference, though not as much as I thought; also
two layers is better than one, but not by much.
